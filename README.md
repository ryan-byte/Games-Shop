<h1> setup locally </h1>

<a name="setup"/>

<br>

ðŸ›‘By default the server uses firebase storage for storing images in the cloud (free no credit card required). if you'd like to use local storage instead of a cloud storage you can use the <b> main-v1.0-(local-storage) </b>branch <b> (Note: main-v1.0-(local-storage) branch will no longer be updated) </b> <br>

ðŸŸ If you want to use a different cloud storage you should modify the script `server/utils/firebaseStorage.js` <br>


#### Steps
1. clone the repo
2. install nodejs from https://nodejs.org/en/download/
3. Install [Dependecies](#dependecies) <br>
4. Add [config.env file](#configFile) <br>
5. Setup [cloud storage account](#cloudStorageSetup) (used for storing images in the cloud) <br>
6. Add [cloud storage configuration](#cloudStorageConfiguration) <br>
7. Add [email auth](#emailAuth) (used for sending verification code to users email) <br>
8. Setup  [gmail openID](#openID) (used so that users can signup/signin with gmail) <br>

<br>

<a name="dependecies"/>

- Open the terminal or cmd at the project directory then run:
```
npm i
```

<br>

<a name="configFile"/>

- Add `config.env` file to the project folder, then add the following:
```
PORT = <integer>
jwtSecretKey = <string>
mongoURL = <mongodb atlas connect url>
digestAlgorithm = <crypto digest algorithm>
apiRequestsPerMin = <integer> 
maxImgUploadSize = <integer>
unverifiedUserDataExpirationTimeInSec = <integer>
logsExpirationTimeInSec = <interger>
```

#### config.env variables
###### PORT (OPTIONAL)
Port used by the server (default value 3000)
###### jwtSecretKey (REQUIRED)
A secret key that is used to sign jwt tokens this key should never be exposed (no default value)
###### mongoURL (REQUIRED)
1. Create a Database in mongodb atlas
2. Press on connect > connect your application > copy the connection string
3. Paste the connection string in the `mongoURL` variable
4. Replace `<password>` with the Database Access user password.
###### digestAlgorithm (OPTIONAL)
Change the digest algorithm that is used for hashing password (default value sha256)
###### apiRequestsPerMin (OPTIONAL)
Max number of API requests a user can make per minute (default value 60)
###### maxImgUploadSize (OPTIONAL)
Max size of the image file for a game (default 5000000 in bytes = 5mb)
###### unverifiedUserDataExpirationTimeInSec (OPTIONAL)
Time for the unverified user to be deleted from the database, also used as an expiration time for verification cookie (default 1800 = 30 min)
###### logsExpirationTimeInSec (OPTIONAL)
Time for the logs to be deleted from the database (default 2592000 = 30 Days)
<br>
<br>
<br>


<a name="cloudStorageSetup"/>

- Create a firebase account > create a firebase project > create a firebase web app > copy the firebaseConfig variable content it looks like this <br>

```
const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: "AsdqzdSDzaqsd468",
  authDomain: "myProjectID.firebaseapp.com",
  projectId: "myProjectID",
  storageBucket: "myProjectID.appspot.com",
  messagingSenderId: "6511211234525",
  appId: "8:213514:61qsd54zqd321:4984365467",
  measurementId: "QZ-SQDZQSDZ651"
};
```

<br>
<br>
<br>


<a name="cloudStorageConfiguration"/>

- Create `firebaseConfig.env` in the app root directory, then add the following:
```
apiKey = <replace it with the right value>
authDomain = <replace it with the right value>
projectId = <replace it with the right value>
storageBucket = <replace it with the right value>
messagingSenderId = <replace it with the right value>
appId = <replace it with the right value>
measurementId = <replace it with the right value>
```
Then replace each variable with the right value from `const firebaseConfig` that we copied in the previous step

<br>
<br>
<br>


<a name="emailAuth"/>

- Create `emailAuth.env` in the app root directory, then add the following:
```
service = <string>
mail = <string>
appPassword = <string>
```
###### service (OPTIONAL)
The service used as an email provider (default "gmail")
###### mail (REQUIRED)
The Address mail used for sending the validation code for validating user signup
###### appPassword (REQUIRED)
For gmail service you should setup an app password (follow these [steps](#setupgmailapp))

<br>
<br>
<br>

<a name="openID"/>

- Create `gmailOpenID.env` in the app root directory, then add the following:
```
clientID = <string>
clientSecret = <string>
redirectURL = <string>
```

Follow this <a href = "https://support.google.com/cloud/answer/6158849?hl=en"> guide </a> to create an oauth client, make sure to add an authorized redirect URI then copy it in the redirectURL field (redirect URI example `http://localhost:3000/openID/google`, make sure you dont set it to an already existing endpoint, to see all endpoints check app.js).<br>
After creating an oauth client and setting up the redirectURL get the clientID and clientSecret by visiting this  <a href = https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials> page</a>, selecting the created client oauth, you should see the clientID with the secret on the top right of the page.

#### Notes:

- **dont use localStorage and sessionStorage to store jwt they are vulnerable to XSS attack**
- **cookies are a possibility to store tokens but to protect from XSS attack use `httponly` option in cookies**
- **cookies are vulnerable to CSRF attack to prevent this set the following option  `sameSite` to `Strict`**
